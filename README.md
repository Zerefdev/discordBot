# discordBot
This is the discord bot I am currently using on my discord.  
If you want to use this bot, make sure to have **Node.js** latest version and **discord.js** library.  
Only *basic* commands are on this repository, I might add more later..
You can make your own commands. If you have difficulties, contact me.  

Code is written by **ZerefGG#4819**
